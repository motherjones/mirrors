# This is a fake article. Have some Riker Ipsum

Do it. Damage report, Geordi.

Here's your loose cover plate... And something compelled me to come
here tonight... though I didn't consciously know what would await
me. It is as though... Will Riker is here with me... I have never felt
that with other hosts. We've locked onto something with markings on
it.

We found a type two phaser in your shuttlecraft. It was taken from the
weapons locker on the station. Worf, get these men back to the
Enterprise. Data, you're with me. She can't be far. Saved by the
bell... Does that mean he'll be able to... Sorry. But what if it's
more than a mere discrepancy? It's an old fashioned way of looking at
the sexes. Not to say that there aren't real differences. Physically,
men tend to be bigger... stronger in the upper body. We have different
sexual organs. Men don't bear young...
